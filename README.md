# Tokyo Maps Project

This project creates a map of locations that I wish to visit in Tokyo.

# Getting Started

To run this program:

* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Open the file index.html to run the program.

# Features

* Google Maps API
* Location information provided by Foursquare
* Photos provided by Foursquare.


# Things you should know

The pictures may not load inside of the info window when you click on a marker. This is usually because I am limited to how many calls I can make to the Foursquare API. If an AJAX request fails an alert dialog box will appear with some information on how to correct the error.
